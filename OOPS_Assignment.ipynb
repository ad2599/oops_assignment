        "\n",
        "**1. Encapsulation**  - refers to bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "Protects the internal state of an object by restricting direct access to its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Provides controlled access through methods (getters and setters).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",

        "**2. Inheritance** -  allows one class (child) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (parent). This promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships.\n",

        "Purpose:\n",
